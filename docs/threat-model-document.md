## Threat Analysis

### Zero-Knowledge Threats
- Risk: User data exposure through misconfigured encryption
  - **Mitigation:** Implement strong encryption algorithms and thorough security audits

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Threats
- Risk: Interception of messages in transit
  - **Mitigation:** Use TLS for all connections, certificate pinning

### Bluetooth Eavesdropping
- Risk: Eavesdropping on Bluetooth communications
  - **Mitigation:** Implement strong pairing protocols and user notifications

### Metadata Leakage
- Risk: Exposure of user communication patterns
  - **Mitigation:** Employ dummy traffic, encrypt metadata

### Admin Compromise
- Risk: Unauthorized admin access to system controls
  - **Mitigation:** Use strong authentication measures, limit admin privileges
